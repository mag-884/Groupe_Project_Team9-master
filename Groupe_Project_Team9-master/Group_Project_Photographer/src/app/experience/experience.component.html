  <h4>Concert photography</h4>
  <br>
 
  <h5>The contrast was my best friend in editing because so easily photos can be too highly exposed and using contrast
    saved most of my images. The color of the light was something I hardly took into consideration. In my apartment, my
    lamps are a warmer light and the main lights are fluorescent so it gave an interesting variety when taking photos.
  </h5>
  <h5>This may sound obvious, but be patient and wait for the right moment to shoot. Focus on the lead singer, find a good
    angle where the mic isn’t obstructing their face and try and watch what the lights are doing. When the light looks
    good and you have a reasonable exposure and the artist looks half decent then shoot. If not try and wait. That said,
    if something spectacular happens like the singer jumps into the crowd or blows a kiss at your camera, then just keep
    shooting! </h5>
